    - Question: How do you think the advances in technology and the Internet affect
        copyright protection in this case?
      Answer: In terms of copyright protection, laws and regulations must adapt to
        these changes. There are challenges in law enforcement when violations occur
        in the digital realm, where localization and identification of offenders
        can be more difficult. I think we need a more innovative and effective approach
        to dealing with copyright infringement in the digital age.

    - Question: How does the film industry impact on illegal downloads and piracy
        of films?
      Answer: The film industry creates jobs for a variety of professions, including
        actors, directors, production crews, and others. If income is reduced due
        to piracy, it can have a negative impact on the job placement in the industry.

    - Question: In the era of streaming and digital distribution, how does copyright
        play in ensuring that filmmakers get proper recognition and reward?
      Answer: Filmmakers can generate revenue through licenses and streaming agreements
        involving the use of their work. Copyright provides a legal basis for negotiating
        contracts with streaming service providers or distributors, ensuring that
        filmmakers receive a fair remuneration. This creates a legal basis for pursuing
        legal action against copyright infringers, which can include claims for damages.
